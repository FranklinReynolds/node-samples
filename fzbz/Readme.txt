FizzBuzz and programmer interviews... Sigh. 

*Begin Rant*

A fizzbuzz programm prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5 print "Buzz" and for multiples of 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz". Fizzbuzz is a problem sooo simple that my grandmother, who never knowingly used a computer and has been dead for many years, could write it. And yet, there are people who use it as an interview question. I did not believe it when I first heard of fizzbuzz, but during an interview for a senior technical position I was asked to solve fizzbuzz - so I know it happens. Friends and colleagues have been asked to solve other problems like enumerating variations or parsing strings.

Which raises the issue of using puzzles or programming problems as an integral part of a job interview. The current fashion in programmer interviews involves puzzles, programming tasks and similar stuff that seems to be, if not completely useless, then at least not very effective. I blame Google for the current enthusiasm for this practice but it has been around forever.

In my experience the typical interviewer has 60 minutes or less to form an opinion about a candidate's knowledge, skills and personality. I think the best interviews encourage the candidate to describe their work in sufficient breadth and detail that the interviewer can begin to form an opinion about the range of the candidate's skills and what it would be like to work with him/her.

Lots of people are uncomfortable being interviewed. If someone cannot solve fizzbuzz during an interview, it is more likely that the candidate is frazzled than they really can not solve the problem. The same is true for implementing string parsing, linked lists or merge sort, etc. 

I am not trying to say that linked lists or sorting algorithms are as trivial as fizzbuzz. I am saying that almost anyone with an undergraduate degree in CS knows how to write simple programs. If you really want to see their code, ask them to bring in samples they can discuss during the interview.

I know we need to conduct job interviews but they seem like a pretty poor way to choose programmers. By far, the most effective way I have found to find good people is to have other good people recommend them. This is the most reliable way to avoid false negatives and false positives.

As an aside, there have been a few attempts to figure out what sort of interview strategies result in hiring the most successful employees. Google's Laszlo Bockcaused a bit of a stir when during an interview with the NYTimes he said that most job interview questions, GPA, test scores, puzzles, etc. are absolutely useless. The only thing that works are behavioral interviews, Bock says, where there's a consistent set of questions that ask people what they did in specific situations. 

*End Rant*

In any case, here is a simple javascript/node.js implementation of FizzBuzz.

And a simple javascript/node.js program to enumerate all the variations that can be created from a collection of lists by taking one item from each list for each variation.
